The topic of game design methodologies and processes has been the subject of study and analysis by various game scholars and designers. However, as both Katharine (2012) and Almeida & da Silva (2013) highlight in their reviews of game design methodologies and tools, there is a lack of journals or papers that report on and evaluate their application. Therefore, this thesis aims to contribute to filling this gap by exploring how insights from an initial game prototype can be used to refine the design process, the development methodology, and the final game outcome. By doing so, we hope to add to the existing literature by evaluating game design processes from the perspective of practical application and arguing that the design process itself is a tool that requires iteration.

To investigate this, we plan to develop an initial game design process informed by pre-existing literature and apply it to the development of a prototype. This prototype will then be analyzed and reflected upon to assess the effectiveness of our design process—how it supports development, contributes to achieving our goals, and where it may fall short. Based on this analysis, we will refine our design process, improve our development methodology, and use what we learn to iterate on the prototype and eventually develop a complete game. Finally, we will reflect on the iterated design process to determine whether and how insights from prototyping have helped improve both the process and the final game.

For the practical application of our design process, we intend to develop a two-player local co-op video game. The final product will be a short (approximately 15 minutes of gameplay) 3D puzzle-platformer in which one player character can push/repel objects while the other can pull/attract them. Players will need to coordinate and combine these abilities to overcome obstacles and reach the end of the game’s level.

Our design process will be developed based on the works of Aghabeigi (2006), Sykes & Federoff (2006), Kultima (2015, 2018), Jonassen (2017), Bernard (2022), and Nyblom (2023). Specifically, Annakaisa Kultima’s Game Design Praxiology (2018) and Developers’ Perspectives on Iteration in Game Development (2015) provide insights into ideation methods, design principles, playtesting, and iteration—key components of our approach. Bardia Aghabeigi’s Understanding and Evaluating Cooperative Video Games (2006) and Alexander Jonassen’s Designing for Couch Co-op (2017) offer valuable guidelines for designing local cooperative video games, while Oscar Nyblom’s Player Experiences in the Game Coridden (2023) provides additional case study insights. Aghabeigi (2006) also developed validated playtesting tools for cooperative game design evaluation, which we plan to use in our iterative process. Furthermore, Jonathan Sykes & Melissa Federoff’s Player-Centered Game Design (2006) will inform our approach to applying user-centered design principles to video game development.

Using this foundation, we aim to establish a design process that begins with defining our guiding principles: we want to create a user- and cooperation-centered game, keep mechanics complementary and easy to understand while allowing for depth in gameplay, and focus on learning objectives and reciprocal respect within our team. These principles will guide us through ideation, where we will use divergent ideation techniques and analyze similar games before moving into the design phase. We will define the abilities of the two player characters and begin designing challenges that require them to use their abilities in tandem.
